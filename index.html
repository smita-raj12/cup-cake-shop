   <h2 class="h2-class">History</h2> 

     <p class="p-class">While cakes have been around for centuries, cupcakes first 
        came around in the 19th century, courtesy of the United States of America.
        The idea behind making tiny cakes was elaborated in ‘American Cookery’, a 
        1796 cookbook by Amelia Simmons. However, the word ‘cupcake’ itself did not 
        come about until 1828, when celebrated author and cooking expert Eliza Leslie 
        published her cookbook ‘Receipts’, which included the recipe for the first cupcake.
        Though Leslie can be credited for cementing the first cupcake recipe, there is no 
        single inventor of this sweet treat. Most of the time, ‘cupcake’ was simply a name 
        for a measurement, much like ‘pound’ cake.
        While the history of the cupcake it somewhat vague, not as clear as most desserts we bake 
        and buy today, one thing is certain—we got a pretty clean and tidy way on miniaturizing the 
        cakes we love, reducing the mess and increasing the joy.
